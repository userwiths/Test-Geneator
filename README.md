This is a really simple program which I wrote in school.

The "teacher" feeds the program questions and answers (correct answers start with \*)
And the program Shuffles the (question,answer) tuples and each answers.
It allows the user to choose the number of tests/shuffles, where to save them
and should it create a key of the correct answers for each version of the test.

The program is writen in C#, and the repository is the actual project folder
generated by Microsof Visual Studio (2012?).

Fun fact:
No matter how simple on a student conference in 2016, when I was (12 grade) presenting my program
it turned out that there were another group of students (12 grade) with the same idea.
Both ideas were mentioned at the award/certificate ceremony.
